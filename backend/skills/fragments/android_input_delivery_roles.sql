-- Which receiver of a physical input event is its application delivery.
-- android_input_events has one row per receiving channel of the same physical
-- event (input_event_id): the app window plus gesture monitors, the pointer
-- dispatcher, wallpaper and navigation bar channels. The stdlib sets
-- event_action only from app-side delivery evidence on a window the receiving
-- process owns, so monitor channels never carry it; an app delivery can still
-- lack it (no `view` atrace, no frame after the event).
--   action       - event_action is known: an observed application delivery.
--   monitor_copy - NULL action, and another row of the same input_event_id
--                  carries one: a monitor observation, not the app's.
--   unresolved   - NULL action on every receiver of the event (trace-edge
--                  events, FOCUS, runtimes that resolve no action).
-- unresolved_event_key identifies an unresolved event once per input_event_id,
-- so counting it DISTINCT gives extra channels of one event no extra weight.
-- Classified over the whole relation, never inside a caller's time window, so a
-- window edge cannot separate a copy from its action-bearing sibling.
-- scene_input_facts.sql applies the same "the action-bearing receiver is
-- primary" rule per stream for scene reconstruction.
-- Requires fragments/android_input_events_normalized.sql listed before it.
