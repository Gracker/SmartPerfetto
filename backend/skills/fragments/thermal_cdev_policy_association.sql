-- Which cpufreq policy a kernel cooling device governs is not declared by any
-- trace event: thermal/cdev_update records only the device name and its
-- target state, and a name such as `thermal-cpufreq-2` is a hint, not a
-- binding. What a trace does record is timing. When the kernel applies a
-- cooling step through cpufreq, the policy's max limit changes right AFTER the
-- cooling transition (tens to hundreds of microseconds on Pixel). This
-- fragment ties a cooling device to a policy only from that evidence.
--
--   transition   a cooling sample whose state differs from the previous one;
--                every transition is counted once (distinct transitions);
--   limit change a valid max-limit sample whose value differs from the
--                contiguous previous valid value (direction tightened/relaxed);
--   pair         FORWARD only: the limit change follows the transition by
--                0..cdev_policy_pair_ms. Each transition is matched to at most
--                one limit change per policy, the first one after it, so a
--                burst of limit updates never counts twice;
--   concordant   cooling tightens while the limit drops, or relaxes while it
--                rises.
--
-- A device is tied to policy P only when it has at least
-- cdev_policy_min_transitions transitions, at least cdev_policy_min_pair_pct %
-- of them pair with P, at least that share of those pairs are concordant, and
-- exactly one policy qualifies. The device name and `cdev_kind_hint` never
-- enter any branch.
